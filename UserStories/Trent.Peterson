This project created a short video game that details a simulated life of the average Americanâ€™s choice of diet. It is not meant to be a purely accurate take, choosing more artistic and cartoony liberties. 

The end goal is to remain healthy after 30 days, by eating healthy and managing time well. There are several manageable stats that change depending on the actions the player takes.
